Introduction

Hello, Portland Means Progress businesses! This Company Dashboard
includes data you’ve provided in Portland Means Progress annual reporting
since you joined the initiative. Each year, we’ll provide your company an
Annual Company Dashboard to provide information for you to reflect on
your progress, celebrate movement, and consider your future actions to
advance racial equity within your organization as well as in our community.
The annual reporting has informed our collective Impact Report, and now
your organizations’ specific information is available to you for individual
reflection. This information remains confidential to your business and is held
by a third party company. If any thing in the report appears inconsistent
with your information, please let R for the Rest of Us know.
The data are displayed in several different graph styles to better help you
visualize what you reported. Circle plots help you see what commitments
you’ve made over the years, with each dot corresponding to the
commitment and each circle representing a single year. Line charts show
change over time. And we include verbatim quotes to provide texture to the
data.

Our intention is to provide another way for your organization to be
intentional in your DEI work. Please feel free to reach out with any questions
and we’re excited to continue our partnership.

Best,<br>
The Portland Means Progress Team
